\usage{
bootstrapFit(
  fit,
  nboot = 200,
  nSampIndiv,
  stratVar,
  stdErrType = c("perc", "se"),
  ci = 0.95,
  pvalues = NULL,
  restart = FALSE,
  plotHist = FALSE,
  fitName = as.character(substitute(fit))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{the nlmixr fit object}

\item{nboot}{an integer giving the number of bootstrapped models to
be fit; default value is 200}

\item{nSampIndiv}{an integer specifying the number of samples in
each bootstrapped sample; default is the number of unique
subjects in the original dataset}

\item{stratVar}{Variable in the original dataset to stratify on;
This is useful to distinguish between sparse and full sampling
and other features you may wish to keep distinct in your
bootstrap}

\item{pvalues}{a vector of pvalues indicating the probability of
each subject to get selected; default value is NULL implying that
probability of each subject is the same}

\item{restart}{a boolean that indicates if a previous session has
to be restarted; default value is FALSE}

\item{fitName}{Name of fit to be saved (by default the variable name supplied to fit)}
}
