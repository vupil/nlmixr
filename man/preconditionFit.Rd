\usage{
preconditionFit(fit, estType = c("full", "posthoc", "none"), ntry = 10L)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A nlmixr fit to be preconditioned}

\item{estType}{Once the fit has been linearly reparametrized,
should a "full" estimation, "posthoc" estimation or simply a
estimation of the covariance matrix "none" before the fit is
updated}

\item{ntry}{number of tries before giving up on a pre-conditioned
covariance estimate}
}
